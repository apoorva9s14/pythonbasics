Modes of execution:

1. Synchronous:
         One by one execution, one after the other
2. Multi threading
        Thread - when I/O bound tasks are present,
		instead of spawning new process(as spawning process is costly),
		in the same process multiple threads are spawned and each thread
		executes independent of one another(Similar to TDMA)
		Concurrency
3. Multi processing
        Parallelism
