# Time Space Cmplexity
# When you insert an item to the container, all the items in the container gets shifted. Same is for delete
# Hence the time comp for such operation where the existing elements get shifted is O(n)
# When yo traverse through the whole container, bigO is O(n)

#For dict - if you have to search for an item, bigO is O(1), but list search bigO is O(n)
#Because of the hash tables for dict.????Worstcase is O(N) for the case - item in dict????
# ????get has O(1) in has O(n)????
