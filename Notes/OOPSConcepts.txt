Object-oriented programming:
Data Attributes + Methods = Object

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism


Encapsulation:
Binding the data and functions into a single unit, the class, we can hide the
private details of a class from the outside world
When we cannot access private data directly, we say that it is well encapsulated.

Abstraction:
Abstract implementation details of class and just expose easy to use interface.
