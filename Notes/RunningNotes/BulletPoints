1. from sys import getsizeof --> gives the memory taken by an object

2. __getattribute__  --> called by default
   __getattr__       --> called if attr not found by __getattribute__

3. operators.itemgetter
   itemgetter(y)(x)  --> x[y]

4. if condition -
    only if the first condition is True, the second condition would be checked
    otherwise the second condition is not even executed

5. psutil.cpu_percent()
   gives the cpu utilisation percentage

6. def is similar to assignment. it assigns a function name at runtime
   The code inside def is not executed until the function is called

7. 'for else' is useful if a 'break' is present in the for loop
   If the for loop does not break and the loop completes,
   then else is executed

8. To know the difference in properties between two data types.
    use set difference

9. The reason behind giving a range of values for N, in competitive programming is:
    if you use two for loops and the max value of N is 10*3, no.of operations needed would be-
    N*2 --> 10^6. Usual sites allow for 10^8 operations/second.
    If max value is 10^5 , then we might get time limit exceeded error.
    So we have to chose the solution wisely, considering the time complexity.

10. Always try to use local variables is possible, as accessing local variable
    is faster than accessing global variables.

11. If you are using a particular inbuilt function multiple times, assign it
    to a local variable, so that we need not do builtin lookup which is slower
    than local lookup.
