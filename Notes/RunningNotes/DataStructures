########### Linear DataStructures #############

Arrays:
    Contiguous memory
    Random Access
    Tightly packed,hence performance optimised

Difference between linkedlists and arrays:
    Linked lists - sequential access
    Arrays - Random access

    Storage of elements of:
    array - continuous
    linked list - dispersed
