DataStructures --> Structures to store data
Linear DataStructures Non-linear DataStructures

########### Linear DataStructures #############
Have a logical start and logical end

Arrays:
    Contiguous memory
    Random Access
    Tightly packed,hence performance optimised

Linked lists:
    can be used to implement Stacks, Queues, Graphs
Difference between linkedlists and arrays:
    Linked lists - sequential access
    Arrays - Random access

    Storage of elements of:
    array - continuous
    linked list - dispersed
    Memory efficiency is better in linked lists, because we dont need to give
    predefined memory, but more memory is needed for storage of linked list


Real world analogies of each data structure
    List    -  Parking lot
    Dict    -  Phonebook
    Stack   -  Stack of plates

Dictionaries
    O(1) operations
    Class attributes are stored in dictionary
    To preserve key order - OrderedDict
    TO give default values for missing keys - Default dict
    To group multiple dicts to single object - ChainMap
    Read only dict - types.MappingProxyType
    To access key as dict.key instead of dict[key] - types.SimpleNamespace

Python Lists
    array.array - list of the same data type
    difference between array and Python list:
    list can store elements of diff data types
    hence it is loosely packed. array is tightly packed
    Arrays are space efficient
    Lists are also allocated contiguous chunks of memory
    If the list grows in size,the append operation will need reallocation of memory
    Because the memory is contiguous, fast access of random elements,slicing is also faster.

Deque
    collections.deque is similar to lists except that insert and remove is faster on both the ends.
    Deque is based on doubly linked list implementation.
    Random access is slow with deque as we need to track the nodes from beginning


    ############Time Complexity##############
    In lists, adding/removing new items need O(n) complexity
    Setting values O(1) complexity.
    Finding length of list is also O(1)
Set
    Union Intersection Difference Subset
    frozen set - immutable set

List vs Stack vs Queue
    Stack - LIFO
    Queue - FIFO
    Stack - Depth First Search
    Queue - Breadth First Search
    Similarities
        Stack - insert and delete, List - push and pop
        Both happen in O(1)
        Every push pop in list doesnt need resizing
    Stacks and Queues don't allow for random access to objects
    collections.deque   -  insert and remove on both the sides
                        -  doubly linked list
    Priority Queue  -  Instead of retrieving the next element by insertion
                       time, a priority queue retrieves the
                       highest-priority element.
    List cannot be used as Queue as, adding/removing elements to the beginning
    needs list resizing

Stacks
    All operations like push and pop are O(1)
    Applications of Stack:
    Undo Redo Changes
    String reversal

Queues
    To maintain order

Hashing
    Hashing helps in fast lookup as the data is stored as key value pair
    Diff b/w hashing, encryption, encoding
    Encryption --> data is jumbled so that only someone with the key
    needed to decrypt the data will have access to it.
    We also want to decrypt the data at some point. In decryption we want to recover the original data.

    Hashing, takes data and produces an output for the purpose of confirming the integrity of data.
    In hashing we have no intention of recovering the original data.

    Encoding merely converts the data into a format that another system can use.
    The goal of encoding is not to obscure data for any security purpose

########### Non-Linear DataStructures #############
Organises the data hierarchically

Tree
    A tree is a collection of nodes.
    Nodes are connected by edges.
    Each node contains a value or data.
    Root - branches - leaves
    Height of the NODE --> length of the longest path from NODE to the deepest leaf
    Depth of the NODE --> length of the path to its root
    Height of the TREE --> height of the node, where node is root

Binary Tree
    Each node has at the most two children.
    Each node has three attributes: value, left_child, and right_child.

Insertion in Tree:
    If the left child node exists, replace that node with the new node
    Add the existing left child node as the new node's left child node

Traversal in Tree:
    Depth first Search, Breadth first Search
    Depth first - First search path: Go to the end of the leaf(i.e.,depth) and then backtrack and search
    Breadth first - First search path: Check the neighbours(i.e.,breadth) and then search the depth

    Pre-order   = Node, left child, right child
    In-order    = left child, Node, right child
    Post-order  = left child, right child, Node

When to use each data structure:
You only have a few (2-3) fields:
plain tuple
Immutable fields:
plain tuples, collections.namedtuple, typing.NamedTuple
You need to lock down field names to avoid typos:
collections.namedtuple and typing.NamedTuple
You want to keep things simple: A plain dictionary object
You need full control over your data structure:
custom class with @property setters and getters.
You need to add behavior (methods) to the object:
custom class
You need to pack data tightly to serialize it to disk or send it over:
 the network: struct.Struct.
