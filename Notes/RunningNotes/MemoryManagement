Real memory exists on RAM chips inside the computer.
Virtual memory is an optimization technique, implemented by the OS.

Virtual memory apparently is greater than physical memory.
Say an OS needs 120 MB of memory, but there’s only 50 MB of available physical
    memory. The OS will create 120 MB of virtual memory, and will use
    virtual memory manager (VMM) to manage that 120 MB.
    The VMM will create 70 MB (120 – 50) swap file/paging file on the hard disk.
    This process is called Swapping.
    Excessive disk swapping, called thrashing, slows down system’s performance

Difference between stack and heap:
They are both stored in the computer’s RAM.
Each thread will have its own stack.
All the threads will share the same heap, so there needs to be coordination between the threads
On a function call, stack is allocated. Once the call completes, stack will be deleted.
Data on the heap will remain there until it’s manually deleted by the programmer.
