An Operating System is a collection of software that manages computer hardware.
It hides hardware complexity, manages computational resources, and provides isolation and protection. 
it directly has privilege access to the underlying hardware. 


Elements of an OS:

(1) Abstractions (process, thread, file, socket, memory), 
(2) Mechanisms (create, schedule, open, write, allocate), and 
(3) Policies (LRU, EDF)
