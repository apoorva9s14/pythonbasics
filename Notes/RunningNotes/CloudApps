To build applications which run as a service, follow the 12factor principles
These principles ensure that
The application is deployable in cloud
Portable across environments
Scalable without major changes


"ABBBCCCDDDLP"

Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages
Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources
Binding
Export services via port binding
Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
Config
Store config in the environment
Concurrency
Scale out via the process model, Horizontal scaling
Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
Dependencies
dependencies should not be part of codebase, it can be put in
manifest and requirements file
Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
Logs
Treat logs as event streams
Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
