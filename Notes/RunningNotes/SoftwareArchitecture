Key principles of Design
1. Availability
2. Performance
3. Reliability
4. Scalability
5. Manageability
6. Cost


Redundancy:
If one fails - get back to other. Nothing is shared.
Each node is independent of other.
#TODO Failover to happen automatically.










Miscellaneous:
Typical Bottlenecks:

Database reads are faster than writes
Webservers have an upper limit on number of simultaneous connections
