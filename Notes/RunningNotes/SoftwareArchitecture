1. BigO Notation
    tells the number of Operations (hence big O)
    tells how fast the algorithm grows --> Rate of Growth
    Eg - Binary Search needs logn operations to search n items
       - running time --> Ologn
    tells worst case run time
    Eg - Binary search can never be slower than Ologn
    Five major run times:
    O(logn), O(n), O(n*logn), O(n*2), O(n!)
    in the order of run times
    O(n) time means you touch every element in a list once.

2. Binary Search - only works for sorted items
    Number of steps needed for binary search of n items:
    2^x = n. "x" steps
    log2 n steps
    With each step the number of items to be searched for
    gets reduced by half

3. Python list is a dynamic array

##########Sorting algorithms##############
Sorting is important as a lot of algorithms work on sorted data

4. Selection sort
    Selection sort is an algorithm that selects the smallest element
    from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element
    at the beginning of the unsorted list.
    Sort by selection

5. Divide and Conquer
    Base case
    with each recursion - you reduce the sample size

6. Brute force vs Sliding window
    Bruteforce Uses two for loops, sliding window slides across the input
    O(n*2) vs O(n)
