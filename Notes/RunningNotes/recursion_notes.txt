1. The tail recursive functions are better than non tail recursive functions
   as tail-recursion can be optimized by compiler because:,
   since the recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing left to do in the current function,
   so there is no need to save the current functionâ€™s stack frame.
   GiveAway - Convert non tail functions to tail recursive functions for further optimisation
