Cache:
    Temporary storage area that stores the used items for easy access.
    Speed factor
    Why are caches faster:
        Small memory size -- reduces the number of scans to retrieve data
        Location  -- Caches are located closer to the consumer (CPU) hence the less latency.
Cache invalidation:
No longer serve the data from cache, instead get a fresh copy

Cache eviction policies:
The item which is returned by this policy is evicted first
1. LRU
    Least Recently Used
2. MRU
    Most Recently Used
3. FIFO
    First in First Out


Python lru cache implementation
In python lru_cache is a decorator in-built in functools

@lru_cache is to to be applied on every function definition
for which lru_cache is needed
