1. memoized_fibonacci.__closure__[0].cell_contents

2. Lambdas : Single Expression Functions
        No Statements, just one single expression

3. Catching all exceptions in a single exception is an anti-pattern

4. Diff b/w shallow copy and deep copy:
        A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then
    populating it with references to the child objects found in the original.
    Shallow copy ==> one level deep copy.
    Deep copy ==> Recursive deep
        A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing
    a new collection object and then recursively populating it
    with copies of the child objects found in the original.

5. Example of recursion -
    String - each char of string is in turn a string
    Deep Copy


6. Static methods are a way to namespace your methods
   Class methods can be used as factory methods to create your own custom
   class objects. You can use the cls variable to create new objects

7. Real world analogies of each data structure
    List    -  Parking lot
    Dict    -  Phonebook

8. Dictionaries
    O(1) operations
    Class attributes are stored in dictionary
    To preserve key order - OrderedDict
    TO give default values for missing keys - Default dict
    To group multiple dicts to single object - ChainMap
    Read only dict - types.MappingProxyType
    To access key as dict.key instead of dict[key] - types.SimpleNamespace

9. Lists
    array.array - list of the same data type
