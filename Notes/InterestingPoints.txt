1. Once the class is deleted,the instances of the class are not getting deleted.
   Same holds true for function objects.
2. There is more than one way to complete the code
   If you are stuck using some method, always explore the other possible way to do it.
   Whenever you are stuck, use dir(module) to explore all the possible options.
3. String is a recursive data type, each character in itself is a string.
4. Lookups are costly, so as far as possible, use functions within the scope
