"""A document which gives the reasoning for
When to use each of the below topics"""

Iterators --> For lazy evaluation
          --> To not load everything into memory
Generators--> Simplified way to create iterators
          --> No need to define __iter__, __next__. Just use yield
          --> Saves the state of the function

Closures --> Function factories
         --> Similar to class with single method
         --> Retain state at the time of creation
         --> They associate some data with the function(similar to class)

Classmethods--> factory methods to create new objects
            --> If the methods wants to create new class object, it can create
                using the cls argument


Descriptors--> #TODO
