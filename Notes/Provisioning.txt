Resource controller -  controlling and tracking the lifecycle of resources in a customer account. 
Resource - could be any service that can be provisioned.

Provisioning (creating an "instance")
binding (creating access credentials) 
Unbinding (removing access) 
Deprovisioning (deleting an "instance")

Service brokers manage the lifecycle of services.
Platforms interact with service brokers to provision, get access to and manage the services they offer. 

OSB (Open serice broker) spec:
OSB Api defines the interaction of service broker with platform so that any software provider
can offer serivces in the platform.

Types of resources:
1. provision-through - Service broker following OSB spec manages resource lifecycle
2. provision-behind - Another API manages resource lifecycle

Aliases:
Symlinks that hold reference to a remote resource and enable interoperability and reuse of a resource instance across the platform. 
For example, you can create an instance of a service in a resource group and then reuse it from any available Cloud Foundry region by creating an alias in an org/space in those regions.

Scoped Token:
Scoped token helps to delegate some of your permissions to another user.
Scoped token identifies as a user but is limited to a set of actions by its scope.

IAM - Identify, authenticate, and authorize
Difference between Authenticate and Authorize:
    Authentication verifies if the users really are who they represent themselves to be. 
    Authorization determines what resources a user can access,
        user permission to access different levels of information.
    Authorization takes place after Authentication.
